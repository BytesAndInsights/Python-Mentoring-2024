# Task 2: Real-World Python Applications

Python is a versatile programming language used in various industries for different applications. Here are three
specific use cases:

### 1. Web Development:

Python is widely used for web development, often with frameworks like Django and Flask. For example, Django, a
high-level Python web framework, is used by companies like Instagram and Pinterest for building scalable and
maintainable web applications.

### 2. Data Analysis:

Python is a popular language in the field of data analysis and data science. Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and
Matplotlib make it easier to analyze and visualize data. For instance, the New York Times uses Python for data analysis
and interactive visualizations to enhance their news stories.

### 3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:

Python is extensively used in AI and machine learning due to its simplicity and the powerful libraries available, such
as TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn. Google uses Python for its AI projects, including their TensorFlow library,
which is one of the most popular tools for machine learning and neural networks.
