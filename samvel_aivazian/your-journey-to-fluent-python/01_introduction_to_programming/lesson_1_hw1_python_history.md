# Task 1: Investigate Python's History

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It was
designed to emphasize code readability and simplicity, which has contributed to its widespread adoption.

### Key Points in Python's History:

- **1980s**: Python's development began as a successor to the ABC language.
- **1991**: Python 0.9.0 was released, containing features like exception handling, functions, and the core data types:
  list, dict, str, and more.
- **2000**: Python 2.0 was released, introducing new features such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection
  system.
- **2008**: Python 3.0 was released to fix design flaws in the language, which included changes that were not
  backward-compatible with Python 2.x.

### What is PEP?

PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a design document providing information to the Python community or
describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. The PEP should provide a concise technical
specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. PEPs are crucial in Python's development process and are
used to discuss and document new features and enhancements.
